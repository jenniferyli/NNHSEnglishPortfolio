              <h2>Stone Belly Girl Discussion</h2>
                <p>The first short story that we read this year was "Stone Belly Girl" by Jamie Granger. At first, it didn't really make sense to me, but after discussing it in class, we saw how each word choice served as an element that built a story and presented a theme. It was my favorite piece that we read this year simply because it showed how much information could be packed into such a short piece of writing.

                <h2>4th Mode: Dumba Chora</h2>
                <p>"Dumba Chora" was the selected story for this year's One City One Story and we were supposed to create a 4th Mode approach to search for a deeper meaning in Chandreyee Lahiri's story. This assignment introduced the Four Modes strategy to me which helps readers comprehend the text. Again, I really liked this short story, and will continue to use this approach to help me understand whenever there may be a deeper meaning.

            <h2>A Recipe For Sentence Types</h2>
              <p>This was an assignment to write a recipe as a narrative that included all 10 sentence patterns. I enjoyed this because it felt a little awkward to construct these sentences but we got rewarded with the sweet cookies afterward!

          <h2>Sophomore Speech</h2>
            <p>The Sophomore speech was an assignment given to all Sophomore students. We were to choose an important topic that advocated for some kind of change, research it, then deliver the 3-minute speech in front of our class. This assignment showed me why the way you deliver the speech and connect to the audience is just as important or maybe even more important than the content of the speech itself. Also, public speaking is not my strength and I had never tried it before so this was a great learning experience.

        <h2>Creative Writing: Mental Illness</h2>
          <p>In this assignment, we were supposed to research a mental illness and through writing, reflect what someone who has that illness experiences. I really like creative writing, however its not my strongest style.  I struggled in writing this, but this assignment showed to me the values of creative writing as well as the importance of adequate and reliable research.
